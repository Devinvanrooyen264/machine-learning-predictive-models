### Contributing

This document outlines some basic guidelines for contributing to the
Developing Machine Learning Models for Predicting Atmospheric Emissions assignment
for the University of Liverpool mid-module programming assignment.

We welcome any patches that fix bugs or general code clean-up.

## Clone from source

You can clone from GitHub with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:asettle/machine-learning-predictive-models.git
```

Or:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asettle/machine-learning-predictive-models.git
```

## Submitting Bugs

I can safely tell you that the program runs, but this does not mean that
the code is devoid of bugs.

All bugs or requests for changes can be filed in [Issues](https://github.com/asettle/data-quality-analysis/issues)
in the GitHub repository.

## Document your changes

If you have modified anything, please ensure that the code is appropriately
commented for my understanding. If you change the way the code is run, ensure
your pull request is submitted with the relevant documentation changes.
